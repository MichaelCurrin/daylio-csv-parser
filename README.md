What is [Daylio](/docs/what_is_daylio.md)?

This _dayliopy_ application parses a CSV exported from _Daylio_ (in premium mode) to create a more useful CSV. In particular, the _activities_ column with multiple activities listed in a single cell is split out into multiple columns, with appropriate names and values as `0` or `1`.

For interest, see related mood tracking projects by other developers [here](/docs/related_projects.md).
