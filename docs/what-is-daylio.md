# What is Daylio?

Daylio is mobile app and their [website](https://daylio.webflow.io/) says:

> "Daylio enables you to keep a private diary without having to write a single line".

Entries are created at a specific date and time and may have the following attributes:

- **Mood:** Choose a value from radio button selection of face icons. These follow a 5-point high to low scale and may be relabelled within the mobile app.
- **Activities:** Tick checkboxes for your custom set of activities. These are only recorded as boolean values, not as counts (though could later be aggregated for a day, week, etc). They can each have custom icon and label and additional activities can be added. An activity might be what you did or how you felt physically/emotionally that day.
- **Note:** An optional text note.
